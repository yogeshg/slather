Q&A
all simulators available on courseworks under projectname/simulator/month-day.zip
you do not see how long a pherome has been on the board
pheromes are point masses. collision occurs if the pherome intersects the cell anywhere
memory is accessed the same way between all of your cells, so if you want each cell to have a different strategy, the strategy needs to be encoded in the memory

Discussion
Zeynap: cells of the same species should stick together to ward off other cells
Adam: for large t, should build walls to keep other species out
Yufei: grab empty space early on in the game to reproduce faster
Michael: carve out certain shapes e.g circles
Yueting: give each cell different strategies so they perform different roles
growth happens from center of cell outwards uniformly. cannot grow in specific directions
if cells are traveling in a formation, need to make sure they move apart slightly in order to ensure sufficient space for reproduction
Jiacheng: use all cells to map out a circle spanning a large perimeter
David: try to have cells predict what neighboring friendly cells will do since they act according to the same code. You don't have complete information to predict since vision is not transitive and the friendly cell's memory is not accessible
Michael: too many other players for an aggressive strategy to be worth it
Florian: only delegate some cells to be aggressive and ruin everyone else's day
Bruce: cells can chase cells of the same species to form a long line like a snake. can follow just a friendly pherome path to increase vision distance

Deliverable for Wedn 9-21:
initial player that does something interesting
